#### Introduction
A short description of the location for the first time the players enter the area. Should be 3-4 sentences. Sentence 1 is a broad visual snapshot of the room; "opening the door reveals a dark and decrepit study room, empty of books." Sentence 2 includes at least one non-visual sensory description; "a musty smell rises from the cold and damp fireplace." Sentence 3 directs the players' attention to the interactable objects in the area, always ending with the last; "you notice what might be runic markings on the desktop of the abandoned study table".
