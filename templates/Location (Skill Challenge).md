## Introduction
A short description of the location for the first time the players enter the area. Should be 3-4 sentences. Sentence 1 is a broad visual snapshot of the room; "opening the door reveals a dark and decrepit study room, empty of books." Sentence 2 includes at least one non-visual sensory description; "a musty smell rises from the cold and damp fireplace." Sentence 3 directs the players' attention to the interactable objects in the area, always ending with the last; "you notice what might be runic markings on the desktop of the abandoned study table".

- **Visuals**: What does the environment look like? What kind of environment is it? Forests, dungeons, castles, caves, canyons, mountains, lakes, oceans, etc.
- **Walls, Etc**: What are the walls like? How high are they? Is there a roof? Special rules for what makes up the location?
- **Special Rules**: Are there any special rules while traveling in the area, such as abnormal gravity, time dilation? What happens if part of the environment is broken, or if the character make too much sound?
- **Theming (One Word)**: What kind of theme is this location going for? What’s the ambience of the area? Is there light? What kind of light, natural or artificial only? Is it spooky? Think of all five senses: sight, hearing, taste, touch, and smell. Include a “sixth sense,” a sensation that characters can feel from everything combined, e.g. a bad feeling, a sense of dread, a sense of comfort or security, of warmth.

| d8 | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Goristo’s Lair: The party stumbles upon the entrance to this demon’s lair |
| 2 | Blue Pebbles: A pool of hundreds of tiny, sapphire-blue glass pebbles have settled on the tunnel floor here. Water drips from small stalactites above and wets the pebbles. If the pebble is thrown and stikes a hard surface, it explodes into a 3rd-level thunderwave spell (4d8 thunder damage, save DC 15). The pebbles are faintly magical, and they're warm to the touch despite the cold dampness of the cave. They have the same weight as a coin. |
| 3 | Minotaur Corpse: The rotting carcass of a minotaur is propped up on one side of this path. The carcass is bloodied, and bits of flesh hang from its horns like Spanish moss. Its fur is thick and coarse, and a long gash runs from under its right armpit down to its thigh, allowing its entrails to spill out beside it. In front of the minotaur is 4 crudely-constructed candles that have since burned out. |
| 4 | Steaming Fissure: At the bottom of this 1-foot wide, 20-foot deep fissure is a Necklace of Adaption. The necklace shimmers like gold, and is normally unreachable at the bottom of the fissure. |
| 5 | Traveling Merchant: The PCs meet a traveling merchant setup in this most unlikely of places. |
| 6 | Fish People: A wandering group of fish-headed humanoids cross paths with the PCs. They do not speak or understand Common. |
| 7 | Bridge Troll: A bridge is the only way across a bottomless chasm, and a large troll is guarding it. |
| 8 | Magical Sword: A sword is stuck inside a stone, and a nearby inscription reads that only the true king of England can pull it out. |
## Random Encounters
