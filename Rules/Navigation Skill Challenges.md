Navigation Skill Challenges serve as a structured system for managing exploration and overland travel in tabletop RPGs. These rules were modified specifically for Pathfinder 2nd Edition. These challenges involve strategic decision-making, skill utilization, and unpredictable events, enriching the transit from one location to another.

This guide will cover:
- **Navigation Points (NP):** The core currency of travel. Players will accumulate NPs through successful checks and problem-solving, while various challenges may subtract them.
- **Travel Modes:** Including Hustle and Avoid Notice, which offer different benefits and potential drawbacks to navigating the environment.
- **Negative Navigation Points:** An optional rule for time-sensitive or high-stakes scenarios.
- **Obstacles:** Diverse challenges that require a range of skills to overcome, stimulating creativity and problem-solving within the party.
- **Special Events and Random Encounters:** Additional layers of complexity, introducing unexpected situations, unique area-specific discoveries, or combat challenges.
# Navigation Challenge
A navigation challenge is broken up into a series of rounds. Each round, the party encounters an obstacle in their attempts to navigate through the area. Their progress is represented by Navigation Points (NP), which start at 0. The number of <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">NP required to successfully navigate to a specified location depends on the duration of the trip, termed screentime</mark>. The party can <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">accumulate NP by successfully overcoming obstacles</mark>. Once the party accumulates the required number of NP, they reach their destination.

During the challenge, the party will encounter a variety of obstacles. These can range from dangerous terrain, hostile creatures, to puzzling situations, and more. The exact nature of the obstacle and the skills required to overcome it vary. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">The DC for overcoming an obstacle is determined by the level of the area (Area Level) and how difficult the area is to traverse, known as the Area Threat.</mark> This final DC is called the Obstacle DC.
### Navigation Points
During a navigation skill challenge, the party aims to accumulate a certain number of Navigation Points (NP). When an obstacle is encountered, the party collectively decides how to overcome the obstacle. A skill check is usually required, and the group's average check result is compared to the Obstacle DC.

>If the average check result meets or exceeds the Obstacle DC, the party successfully overcomes the obstacle and gains 2 NP. If the result is a Critical Success, the group gains 3 NP. On a failed check, the party gains 1 NP, and no NP are awarded on a critical failure.

Failure to overcome an obstacle might also result in a Random Encounter. The chance to trigger a random encounter is determined by the Area Threat. Depending on the area, a critical failure can also result in an immediate hostile encounter with no chance to avoid or spot it.
### Time Limits
Typically, a navigation challenge assumes that the characters will inevitably reach their destination. However, there may be situations where the characters have a limited time to reach their destination or are otherwise at risk of failing the challenge. For such instances, the GM can opt to use the Time Limits rule.

In this optional rule, the GM should set a limited number of rounds to complete the challenge. The number of rounds of a rushed challenge will depend on the urgency of the situation. The GM should reference the Screentime section of this document for a suggested number of rounds based on how long the challenge should normally take.

If the party fails to reach their Navigation Point goal within the set time limit, they fail the challenge. This can represent getting lost, failing to reach the destination in time, or any other relevant consequence. However, keep in mind that failure should always push the story forward in some way and not just bring the adventure to a halt.
## Exploration Activities
At the start of a navigation challenge, each party member chooses an [Exploration Activitity](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=471) to perform for the duration of the challenge. The chosen activity can only be changed after an obstacle has been overcome or an encounter has occurred. Individual party members cannot choose to Hustle or Avoid Notice, however; those activities are decided by the group at the start of the challenge (see below).
### Activities
Inspired by the BREAK!! RPG. Four main activities or roles: Vanguard, Lookout, Rearguard, or Scout.
- Vanguard: Person leading the group. If the party is attacked, then the vanguard can take the blow for any lookouts behind. If they do so, they do not get a save. If they choose to avoid, they get a save as normal, and so do any lookouts. Typically, they can also have the Raise a Shield activity active.
- Rearguard: The same as vanguard, but from the rear.
- Lookout: Person in the middle. When an encounter happens, each lookout can roll Perception to notice the encounter to prevent an ambush. Can also continually cast Detect Magic if they so wish.
- Scout: Little shit
### Hustle and Avoid Notice
At the start of the navigation challenge, the group can decide to Hustle or Avoid Notice (or neither). If the group Hustles or Avoids Notice, they gain the benefits and drawbacks of their choice for the entire duration of the challenge. Like other exploration activities, the group can decide to change their pace after an obstacle has been overcome or an encounter has occurred.

>**Hustle**: While Hustling, your group moves quickly, but at the cost of making a major error. Whenever your group rolls a success to overcome an obstacle, you get a critical success instead. However, if your group rolls a failure, you get a critical failure instead. Each member of your group also suffers a -2 circumstance penalty to all Perception and Stealth checks.

>**Avoid Notice**: While Avoiding Notice, your group moves slowly but cautiously, reducing chances of unwanted attention. Each member of your group gains a +2 circumstance bonus to all Perception and Stealth checks. However, critical successes to overcome an obstacle only count as normal successes. As usual, you and your group can roll a Stealth check instead of a Perception check at the start of an encounter to determine initiative and to see if enemies notice you and your group (based on their Perception DCs, as normal for Sneak, regardless of their initiative check results). If your average Stealth check is greater than the highest Perception DC of all of the enemies in an encounter, your group can decide to bypass the encounter entirely.
## Obstacles
In the context of a navigation challenge, obstacles are events, situations, or entities that potentially impede the party's progress. They represent the unforeseen complications that can occur during an expedition and are intended to test the party's resourcefulness and adaptability. Depending on the terrain, obstacles can range from natural phenomena like avalanches, rockslides, and dense vegetation, to geographical hurdles like cliffs and rivers, to guarded areas like patrols and checkpoints.

At the start of each round in the navigation challenge, the party encounters an obstacle. Successfully overcoming an obstacle directly results in an increase in NP. However, choosing to circumvent the obstacle may cost the party an NP, representing the additional time or the possibility of getting lost.

>Importantly, not all party members need to use the same skill to tackle an obstacle. Some obstacles might have multiple feasible approaches, each demanding a different skill or tactic. This can lead to diverse and engaging solutions, as each character might approach the same problem in their own unique way.
### Key Skills and Secondary Skills
Every obstacle includes a key skill, which represents the most straightforward or obvious way to overcome it. Players can use the key skill to attempt to overcome the obstacle without any penalty. However, the party is not limited to only using the key skill. With the GM's approval, players can attempt to use different skills to overcome the obstacle, though this might come with penalties depending on the relevance and applicability of the chosen skill. A skill that is a little less applicable imposes a -2 penalty, while a skill of questionable use, or one that would be especially difficult to apply, carries a -4 penalty.

Each area typically includes a prepared list of 10-20 obstacles specific to the area. However, the GM can and should improvise obstacles as the party travels to avoid duplicate obstacles, or ones that don’t make sense.
## Screentime
The screentime of a navigation challenge is the length of the challenge. The Screentime table gives approximations for the amount of actual time spent during skill challenges of varying lengths, and the number of Navigation Points required to reach their intended destination.

If the players have a time limit to complete the challenge, the recommended number of rounds are also given by screentime length, by Round Limit. The GM can adjust the time limit based on the urgency of completing the challenge, but doing so can make the challenge significantly easier or more difficult.

|Screentime|Short Encounters|Overland Travel|NP Goal|Round Limit|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Very Short|0–10 minutes|1 day|5 NP|3|
|Short|11–60 minutes|1–3 days|7 NP|4|
|Medium|1–4 hours|3–7 days|9 NP|5|
|Long|4–8 hours|8–14 days|11 NP|6|
|Very Long|8+ hours|14+ days|13 NP|7|
## Area Statistics
Each area that a navigation challenge takes place in has its own statistics that determines the obstacle DC, the level of the creatures in the region, and how difficult the area is to survive in.
### Obstacle DC
Each area has an Obstacle DC, a guideline for the difficulty of navigating in the area and what each skill check is against. Use the Level-Based DCs table in the CRB to determine the base DC, then add a bonus depending on the area’s threat.
### Foraging
If the party needs to forage for food and water, the Obstacle DC should be used to subsist.
### Area Level
The area’s level is a stand-in for the expected party level of the characters. It is used to determine creature levels in encounters and is the main determinant of the Obstacle DC. The area level also influences the encounter budget for each encounter threat level. Since the area level is independent of the party’s character levels, the PCs could run into real trouble if they wander into a high-level area before they’re ready, or they might find that lower-leveled areas are much easier upon revisiting.
### Area Threat
The Area Threat of a region is a representation of how dangerous the area is independently of the area’s level. The threat can influence the final Obstacle DC of the area, the density of hostile encounters, and how often encounters are triggered.

If the party critically fails to overcome an obstacle, instead the encounter chance by +25% across all threat levels.
##### Area DC By Level
|Level|Base Obstacle DC|
|---|---|
|0|14|
|1|15|
|2|16|
|3|18|
|4|19|
|5|20|

##### Area Threat Effects
|Area Threat|DC Adjustment|Encounter Chance|
|---|---|---|
|Easy|+0|25%|
|Medium|+1|50%|
|Hard|+2|50%|
|Deadly|+3|75%|
## Special Events
Special Events are unique and intriguing elements incorporated into the navigation challenge to enhance the area's thematic depth and distinctiveness. They can be introduced following successful obstacles or encounters, adding flavor and additional engagement opportunities.

These events can present a variety of rewards, such as treasures, NPC interactions, unique vistas, or interesting details about the area. This approach can effectively replace friendly random encounters, concentrating on Special Events instead to enrich the exploration narrative.

Special Events are typically introduced through a table roll, executed either at the end of a successful obstacle attempt, at day's end, or upon completion of the navigation skill challenge.

However, the table's usage should be tailored to the party's pace and performance. If the party is progressing slowly or consistently underperforming, it may be best to bypass the table to expedite travel. Conversely, if the party is exceptionally successful, a special event can be introduced as a dynamic replacement for the round's usual obstacle check. This ensures an engaging and balanced pace throughout the navigation challenge.

## Random Encounters
What sorts of monsters and enemies are present in the area? Who or what would attack the characters or pose a challenge? What are their goals? Can some encounters be resolved peacefully? If the characters run into a random encounter, the GM should roll on a Random Encounter table for the region, which typically contains 10 to 20 different encounters.

You should roll a d4 to determine if the characters run into a random encounter either after every obstacle attempt, or just after every failure. The chance to run into an encounter is based on the Area Threat of the area. For Easy or Medium areas, there’s a 25% chance of a random encounter (rolling a 1). For Hard or Deadly areas, there’s a 50% chance of a random encounter (rolling a 1 or 2). <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">A critical failure to overcome the obstacle increases the odds of a random encounter by +25%.</mark>

If the characters run into a random encounter, the type of encounter is also dependent on the Area Threat of the region. The more dangerous the area, the higher the distribution of Hostile encounters.

>**Types of Encounters**: There are four basic types of encounters that the characters might face: a creature encounter, a trap encounter, an environmental encounter, or a social encounter. A creature encounter is a normal combat random encounter which more often than not includes savage monsters. A trap encounter occurs when the characters have sprung some sort of trap. An environmental encounter includes puzzles, riddles, or natural/supernatural phenomenon. A social encounter is perhaps the most devious of all and might require the characters to interact cordially instead of resorting to violence.

### Hostility
By default, random encounters are hostile. They present challenges of at least Trivial difficulty, featuring creatures or traps that post a threat to the party. The distribution of encounter difficulty is static, according to the Encounter Threat Distribution table.

Regardless of their nature, encounters should test the party's resources. A trivial threat might be a minor trap that drains HP, a complex obstacle necessitating the use of a spell slot, or an encounter that imposes a long-term effect on a character.
##### Encounter Threat Distribution
|Encounter Threat|Distribution|# out of 10|# out of 12|# out of 20|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Trivial|10%|1|1|2|
|Low|20%|2|2|4|
|Moderate|50%|5|6|10|
|Severe|15%|1|2|3|
|Extreme|5%|1|1|1|
## Treasure
In addition to the satisfaction of overcoming obstacles and encounters, treasure offers a tangible reward and incentive for the characters' journey. The treasures listed here can be used as individual rewards for particularly challenging obstacles or encounters, or as a reward chosen from the Special Events table. Some treasure may require the characters to put in extra effort to obtain it.

The treasures can range from unique items, a small treasure hoard, or even something much grander. Consider the player characters' level, their current resources, and the challenge they faced when selecting an appropriate treasure.

Use the table below as a reference when deciding what treasures to reward your players with:
##### Treasure
|d10|Treasure|
|---|---|
|1|A beautifully crafted elven bow, humming softly with arcane energy.|
|2|A small bag filled with gemstones of various sizes and colors, some of which may be rare.|
|3|A potion of healing and 100 experience.|
|4|An old, weather-beaten map that leads to a hidden cache of gold and equipment.|
|5|A gilded tome, written in a forgotten language, that holds the secrets of an ancient spell.|
|6|A pouch containing seeds of the rare Silverleaf plant, said to have powerful healing properties.|
|7|A beautifully preserved dragon scale, shimmering with potential magical energy.|
|8|A pouch of 12 gold coins, 17 silver coins, and 5 copper coins.|
|9|An ornate key, adorned with mysterious runes, possibly opening a door to a long-forgotten dungeon or treasure vault.|
|10|A tiny golden statuette of a griffon, its eyes set with glittering diamonds.|

Remember, not every treasure has to be purely material. Information, alliances, experience, or story progression can also be rewarding for your players. Consider the narrative, campaign setting, and your players' interests when deciding what treasures to include in your adventure.
